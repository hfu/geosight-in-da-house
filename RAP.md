# GeoSight in da House 🎤

*A tribute to the journey of bringing enterprise geospatial tech to Raspberry Pi*

---

## Verse 1: The Vision

Yo, we started with a vision, international scale  
UNICEF's GeoSight, enterprise ain't frail  
But centralized servers, they come with a cost  
Communities need power, agency ain't lost  

In da house, yeah we bringing it home  
Raspberry Pi 4B, no need to roam  
Decentralize the stack, Unix knowledge deep  
ARM64 on the rise while the skeptics sleep  

---

## Chorus

GeoSight in da house, we ain't backing down  
Docker Compose, Justfile, turning code around  
From AMD64 to ARM, we adapt and we learn  
Raspberry Pi burning, watch the tables turn  

In da house, in da house (yeah!)  
Open source power, breaking out!  
In da house, in da house (what!)  
Local-first vision, no room for doubt!  

---

## Verse 2: The Struggle

Six-year-old images, logrotate won't compile  
Platform mismatch errors stretching for a mile  
`blacklabelops` stuck on AMD, we had to pivot  
Alpine Linux stepping in, now we in it  

Webpack eating 180% CPU all day  
Dev mode hot reload? Nah, production's the way  
`npm run build` once, then the container sleeps  
Memory optimized, performance it keeps  

PostGIS from source, pg-backup too  
Building on ARM takes patience, it's true  
15-30 minutes, but we persist through the pain  
Dockerfiles crafted, custom builds for the gain  

---

## Verse 3: The Technique

Makefile integration, `${ARGS}` not env  
COMPOSE_FILE syntax had us debugging again  
Healthcheck from `main.js` to `bundles/frontend/`  
Production mode only, development we transcend  

Template system, `docker-compose.override` chains  
Base → override → ARM64 → production remains  
`.env` generation, secrets randomized tight  
Security by default, doing Unix right  

`just install`, `just run`, automation complete  
Git pull, rebuild, containerized beat  
SSH expect scripts, monitoring remote  
tmux sessions keeping progress afloat  

---

## Chorus

GeoSight in da house, we ain't backing down  
Docker Compose, Justfile, turning code around  
From AMD64 to ARM, we adapt and we learn  
Raspberry Pi burning, watch the tables turn  

In da house, in da house (yeah!)  
Open source power, breaking out!  
In da house, in da house (what!)  
Local-first vision, no room for doubt!  

---

## Verse 4: The Philosophy

This ain't opposition to the powers that be  
It's complementary tech, setting data free  
International orgs doing work that's real  
But local deployment? That's the community deal  

Downsize and distribute, sovereignty intact  
Geographic insights where the people at  
No cloud dependency, no vendor lock-in  
Raspberry Pi forest where the change begins  

"In da house" ain't about making yourself look tall  
It's about bringing enterprise tech to one and all  
Decentralized power, knowledge in the local node  
Self-hosted solutions on the freedom road  

---

## Bridge

From `/bin/sh` errors to healthcheck delays  
We debugged through nights, through the ARM64 maze  
Every `git commit`, every override file  
Building infrastructure, going the extra mile  

270% CPU, webpack building slow  
But patience is Unix, this we know  
Idempotent scripts, reproducible state  
Infrastructure as code, make it great  

---

## Final Chorus

GeoSight in da house, mission nearly complete  
Django, nginx, PostgreSQL suite  
Celery workers, Redis cache in place  
Geospatial power at the local space  

In da house, in da house (yeah!)  
Raspberry Pi strong, no backing out!  
In da house, in da house (what!)  
Technology for all, that's what it's about!  

---

## Outro

So here's to the journey, the errors we faced  
ARM64 compatibility, no code to waste  
From templates to Dockerfiles, every line refined  
GeoSight in da house, for all humankind  

Two commands is all it takes, automation complete  
`just install; just run` - feel that beat  
Raspberry Pi 4B running enterprise grade  
Geographic justice, the foundation we laid
